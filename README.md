# Arduino libraries for the DCF77

## DCF77

Libraries for Arduino to connect to the DCF77 clock receiver module from Conrad Electronic

Original DCF77 library version is from:
https://github.com/thijse/Arduino-Libraries/tree/master/DCF77


The DCF77 library adds the ability to read and decode the atomic time broadcasted by the 
DCF77 radiostation.

With the included Time library, you can run the SyncProvider sketch example.

## Time

This library is from:
http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Time

It differs as of 1 Nov. 2014 from that version that is available for download there.
Some files have been patched for the "const" compiler errors seen in later Arduino
IDE versions. (See the git version history)
